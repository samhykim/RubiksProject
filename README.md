##Rubik's Cube WebPage Project

So I decided to take the frontend challenge and wow, it was a lot more work than I thought.
So my overall vision was to have 4 separate pages written in Angularjs. One is just the main page that shows a picture of a rubik's cube.
Other other three are pages that let you interact with a cube, shows the list of records of fastest times for solving 
a rubik's cube, and a page that shows you how to solve one. Of course, I did not have time to finish most of these as you will 
see in the project but definitely it was heading in the right direction. 
The steps I took to work on this challenge were:
	1. Create an index page with all of the libraries and scripts imported and correctly 
	   create links to 3 other separate pages.
	2. Work on each page individually. 
	3. Clean up any code and style issues.

I also added an interactive walkthrough the help navigate through the site, but I only put it
in because it was something cool I discovered over the summer and wanted to try it out.

In these three hours, I spent actually a lot of time googling how to do certain things like using 
cool CSS3 functionalities and Angularjs functionalities. It would have been helpful 
to collaborate and specialize in certain areas of the code where each of us is most proficient.
But please take a look at the project.
